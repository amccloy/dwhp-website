      We work with our partners to develop a strategic plan to accelerate growth. This could involve an aggressive strategy to acquire competing businesses to consolidate the market, or it could include the build-out of a direct sales force to launch innovative products in a new channel. Whatever the situation, we are uniquely positioned at DW Healthcare Partners to help our partners plan and execute their desired growth strategies.

    <h2>Building Strong boards</h2>
    <p>
      With every investment, we help our partners create a strong, highly-functional board of directors. An independent board of directors offers our partners a forum where new ideas and approaches can be discussed, and discipline can support capital allocation decisions.

        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          We demonstrate flexibility when structuring transactions, and when catering to an owner's goals post-closing. We prefer partnering with management teams, but have the bench strength to deploy executives in buyout situations, when owners seek full liquidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prefer to purchase control in transactions, but have the ability to invest in minority transactions as well.

        <h3>Growth</h3>
        <p>
          Our key focus is our orientation toward growth, whether it be through organic initiatives or via strategic acquisitions. This focus also impacts the way we capitalize businesses, as we avoid the burden of undue leverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We generate returns by working with management teams to grow businesses and not by handcuffing growth with excessive debt.
